# RSA-Key-Breaking-Using-Shors-Algo
The program take plaintext(maximum length -16 and type - varchar + special character) as password from user and then Encrypts the plaintext message using the public key of RSA. After Encryption information is known as ciphertext. Then using Shor's Quantum algorithm to decrypt the encrypted message using the private key.
